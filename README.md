# The Ultimate Spring Boot Course

This repository contains the starter project for Part 2 of my Spring Boot course:

[https://codewithmosh.com/p/spring-boot-building-apis](https://codewithmosh.com/p/spring-boot-building-apis)

## About this Repository 

This project is based on the final project from Part 1 of the course, but I’ve cleaned it up and removed unnecessary playground code so we can focus on building APIs in Part 2.

You’ll be cloning this repository and coding along with me as we extend the project.

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/spring-api-starter

cd spring-api
```
